<h1>MB Tile archives</h1>
<p>Most maps on the internet an mobile devices can be zoomed in like the well known Google Maps. At each zoom level the map you see consists of a number of 'tiles' (small square bitmap areas/files) that are each downloaded separately from a server. At each zoomlevel and more detailed set of tile-bitmaps is downloaded from the server. Sometimes on a slow connection you can see the map being built up from these tiles.</br>
For some applications, like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geeksville.gaggle">Gaggle</a>, 
it can be beneficial not to have to download these tiles, because there's no internet connection in flight, 
because the internet connection is expensive abroad, or because the internet connection drains the battery of the mobile device. For that we have tile-archive: a file containing the tiles of a specific area on the planet at several zoomlevels.
An mb-tile-archive is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite">sqlite</a> database-files with an extension .mbtiles that 
contains the bitmap tiles for an area</p>
<p>On On this sit<acronym></acronym>e you can find the following resources for dealing with archives:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hansvdam/GaggleDocumentation/wiki/Creating-an-offline-maptile-archive">Instructions on how to create mbtiles archives</a> yourself of the area where you want to fly with Gaggle.
<li>A <a href="archivemap/index.html">collection of ready made archives</a> for well known flying locations. 
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/hansvdam/MBTilesProcessor">tool for merging multiple archives</a> into one archive.
<li>A <a href="http://viswaug.wordpress.com/2011/06/28/mbtilesviewer/">tool for viewing mbtiles-archives on a PC</a> (you drag archives on the windows of this application to open them)</a>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kataplop.android.gaggle.beta">Gaggle (beta)</a> can deal with mutiple archives with no problems. They just have to be put in a directory called 'osmdroid' on your android phone's sd-card:</p>

<p>and then they can be selected from within Gaggle (beta):</p>
